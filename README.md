Anna Gagnebin (Sacramento State Physics, 2023)

This repository contains:
1. Code
- A Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - code that can be easily used to visualize the drift of a potential signal from any source on the sky observed at any location on the Earth
  - a detailed walkthrough of the code
  - an overview of the background research I did this summer on coordinate systems and how to use astropy for drift rate analysis
- Files written by Dave DeBoer that are needed to run the Notebook
2. Presentations
- A poster from the 2021 Assembly of the Order of the Octopus
- Slides from the Cal-Bridge Summer Research Symposium

There are a number of steps which may be taken following the end of the this summer:
Next steps:
- In the Notebook:
  - Edit the Notebook so it may be run independently of the two python files written by Dr. DeBoer
  - Investigate a way to connect to JPL Horizons through the Notebook instead of imbedding a link to the website
  - Edit the way noise is added into the waterfall plots so they would look more like a real signal
- In general:
  - Edit code written by Dr. DeBoer that deal with the other potential causes of drift (outlined in the Notebook)
    - Possibly create a new Notebook for each
